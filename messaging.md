# myTruv — Messaging (No‑Hustle AI Autopilot & One‑Score)

## 0. Purpose

This file translates the **brand + positioning** into **actual words**:
- how we describe myTruv,
- how we talk about problems and outcomes,
- how we adapt the message to different jobs‑to‑be‑done,
- what we never say.

Use this as the starting point for:
- website copy,
- onboarding flows,
- emails & notifications,
- ads and social,
- investor / sales one‑pagers (language layer).

## 1. Core One‑liners

### Primary

> **“AI‑powered, no‑hustle financial autopilot: one calm score, one scroll, and a couple of simple steps to keep your money on track — even when income is messy.”**

### Alternates

> **“An AI money companion: one score, one scroll, and always worth opening.”**

> **“See your money in one calm score and a few clear actions — so you can finally breathe out.”**

> **“Money that feels lighter: AI watching your system, you just check in.”**

Use the **primary** on home/hero and product pages.  
Use **alternates** in ads, social, press, and where brevity matters.

## 2. Core Narrative

This is the **Boss‑level story**: Problem → Insight → Solution → Outcome.

### 2.1 Problem (as people feel it)

- “I don’t want to live inside a budgeting app.”
- “I’m not going to update spreadsheets forever.”
- “My income and expenses change every month — budgets never really stick.”
- “Every time I open a money app, I end up feeling guilty.”

Money tools feel like:
- **homework** (log, categorise, maintain),
- **judgment** (red bars, ‘over budget’, broken streaks),
- and a **second job** (“be your own CFO”).

### 2.2 Insight

People don’t want another tool or discipline challenge.  
They want:

- a **quick read** on their money (“Am I okay?”),
- a **sense of direction** (up/down, safer/less safe),
- **1–2 realistic moves** that help, right now,
- and to **stop feeling bad** every time they check their accounts.

They want something that’s:

- always worth opening,
- never shames them,
- smart enough to understand messy real life.

### 2.3 Solution

- You connect your bank accounts and cards once.
- myTruv’s AI watches what happens in the background:
  - income, bills, everyday spending,
  - trips, big purchases, weird months.
- On the surface, you get:
  - **one financial wellbeing score** that moves slowly and makes sense,
  - a **one‑scroll overview** of balances, cushions and trends,
  - **1–3 simple actions** in plain language.

No daily budgeting rituals, no category‑gardening.

### 2.4 Outcome

- “Okay, that’s how much the Vegas weekend and flights actually cost. I can see how it affected my score, and what to tweak next. It’s fine. Life goes on.”
- “I know if I’m still safe, even though this month is weird.”
- “I don’t dread opening my money app anymore — it’s mostly good news and small corrections.”

## 3. Key Message Pillars

Use these as **building blocks** for any copy.

### 3.1 No‑hustle financial autopilot

- “You don’t need to ‘do your finances’ every day.”
- “myTruv is designed to be **checked, not worked in**.”
- “It quietly watches your patterns and surfaces **high‑leverage actions** only when they matter.”
- “Open, scroll once, see your status and 1–2 next steps — then get back to your life.”

**Every check‑in should feel rewarding**:
- a small “you’re on track” moment **or**
- a gentle, doable suggestion —
- never a red ‘you failed’ wall.

---

### 3.2 One calm score you can trust

- “Think of it like a credit score, but for your **overall money system**, not just your debt.”
- “Your Truv Score moves **gradually**, based on real patterns — not every coffee.”
- “On most days, it simply tells you:  
  **‘You’re okay.’**  
  or  
  **‘This month is tighter — here’s how to stay safe.’**”

---

### 3.3 Always‑worth‑opening, shame‑free

- “You should never have to brace yourself before opening a money app.”
- “myTruv never shames you. It talks like a kind, practical friend:
  - ‘Here’s what happened.’
  - ‘Here’s why it’s understandable.’
  - ‘Here’s one thing you can do next.’”
- “Bad months don’t trigger red alarms — they trigger context and guidance.”

---

### 3.4 Story‑based insights, not spreadsheets

- “We did a Vegas weekend / a week in Cancun / a Disney trip — how much did that actually cost us?”
- “What did that new iPhone + plan actually do to our month?”
- “Why does this month feel so tight?”

myTruv:

- groups transactions into **stories** (trips, moves, big purchases, weird months),
- shows **total cost and main drivers**,
- gives a **calm verdict**:
  - “This was a big month, but still inside your safe range.”
  - “This is the main reason your score dipped a bit.”

---

### 3.5 Works with irregular / messy income

- “Budgets assume every month looks the same. Real life doesn’t.”
- “myTruv smooths your ups and downs into one clear picture:
  - are you building cushion,
  - using cushion,
  - or slowly burning through it?”
- “Freelancer month, bonus month, slow month — your score stays readable and honest.”

## 4. JTBD‑Based Messages

**Message**

- “You can go weeks without checking. When you come back, you’re greeted, not punished.”

### 4.5 Big life events & shocks

> “Trips, moves, car repairs, medical bills — I just want to know what they did to my system.”

**Message**

---

### 5.3 Disney trip with kids

- “You spent **$2,450** on your Disney trip with the kids.”
- “Tickets, hotel and food in the park are 80% of the cost.”
- “Because you’d built some cushion, this shows up as a **planned spike**, not an emergency.”
- “We’ll watch your next few months and let you know when your safety net is back to pre‑trip level.”

---

### 5.4 New iPhone / laptop upgrade

- “Your new phone and plan cost **$1,120** with taxes.”
- “You kept the rest of your spending pretty close to normal, so this month is heavier but controlled.”

---

### 5.6 Medical bill

- “The medical bill came out to **$1,350**.”
- “This is the main reason this month feels tight — other categories stayed normal.”
- “This isn’t you ‘spending badly’; it’s just a very expensive system.”
- “We’ll help you spread the impact so you don’t wipe out your safety net.”

---

### 5.7 Moving to a new apartment

- “Moving to your new place cost about **$2,900** (deposit, rent, furniture, services).”
- “That fully explains why this month is off the chart compared to your usual.”
- “If the next 1–2 months are calmer, your score will climb back without heroic effort.”

---

- “Your income was **35% higher** this month thanks to your side‑hustle.”
- “You used part of it for treats and part to grow your cushion.”
- “Your Truv Score jumped — we’ll show how much of that is from extra work vs. better habits.”
- “We’ll help you lock in the good part so one strong month doesn’t just disappear.”

---

## 6. What We *Don’t* Say (and How to Rewrite It)

**We avoid:**

- “Close your financial rings daily or you failed.”
- “You blew your budget again.”
- “Stop wasting money.”
- “Fix your bad money habits.”
- “Track every dollar.”

**We prefer:**

- “This month was heavier on big purchases. Your score dipped a bit — nothing dramatic, just something to keep an eye on.”
- “You had a quiet month. Your score ticked up — you’ve added a bit more protection.”
- “Delivery spending has crept up. You’re still okay; skipping one or two orders this week keeps your score stable.”
- “You had a rough week. That happens. Here’s one simple action to feel safer by next week.”

Always ask:  
> “Would I want to open this app again after reading this?”  
If the answer is “no”, the message is off‑brand.

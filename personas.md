# myTruv — Personas (No‑Hustle Autopilot & One‑Score)


> Same core personas as before — but explicitly tuned to prefer  
> **“one score + one scroll + no hustle + shame‑free autopilot”**  
> over daily quests, heavy gamification, or manual budgeting.


---

## Persona 1 — “Exhausted Power User”

**Snapshot**

- Age: 30–40  
- Income: $50–90k household  
- Status: Full‑time or self‑employed  
- Tech: Advanced, 6+ hours online/day  
- Devices: Android + Windows skew  
- Tools today: bank app, spreadsheets, 1–2 budgeting apps (Mint / YNAB / Monarch / etc.)

**Money situation**

- Knows *exactly* how to set up budgets, categories, spreadsheets.
- Has tried multiple “systems” and can talk in detail about them.
- Still feels like money is **never fully under control**:
  - income or expenses fluctuate,
  - feels like constant micromanagement,
  - gets tired and drops the system every few months.

**Primary pains**

- “I know what to do, I just don’t have the mental energy to do it non‑stop.”
- Tool fatigue: everything turns into **more dashboards and more work**.
- Feels guilty when they stop maintaining the system for a few weeks.
- Hates that every app assumes they want to become their own CFO.

**Why no‑hustle + one score fits**

- They **do not want another system to maintain**.
- They want:
  - to connect accounts once,
  - see a **single wellbeing score**,
  - scroll once to understand what changed and what to do.
- They appreciate that the score **moves slowly** and reflects their system, not every small decision.

**What resonates**

- “You don’t need to maintain myTruv — it maintains itself.”
- “Not another dashboard. One score, one scroll, 1–3 meaningful actions.”
- “Your Truv Score moves gradually, based on patterns — not random daily noise.”
- “We sit on top of your spreadsheets and bank apps and turn them into one clear signal.”

**What to avoid**

- Heavy “build your perfect budget” narratives.
- Daily streak pressure (“log in every day or you lose your progress”).
- Anything that looks like yet another complex control panel.

## Persona 2 — “Emotional iOS Spender”

**Snapshot**

- Age: late 20s to mid‑30s  
- Income: $40–80k household  
- Status: Full‑time or full‑time + side gigs  
- Tech: Intermediate → comfortable with iOS, hates complex UIs  
- Devices: iPhone + Mac  
- Tools today: bank app, maybe a budgeting app, sometimes a simple spreadsheet

**Money situation**

- Does okay most of the time, but:
  - spends more when stressed or sad,
  - has cyclical “treat yourself” months,
  - sometimes avoids looking at accounts for days/weeks.
- Feels **guilt and shame** around money:
  - “I know I should be better with this.”
  - “I don’t want an app yelling at me.”

**Primary pains**

- Rings and streaks quickly become:
  - “I broke the streak → I failed → I’ll avoid the app.”
- Budgeting apps feel like a constant judgment:
  - red bars,
  - “over budget” warnings,
  - lots of numbers without emotional safety.
- Feels overwhelmed by the idea of being “perfect” with money.

**Why no‑shame + no performance game matters**

- A single, calm score plus gentle explanations feels **emotionally safe**.
- They want an app that **explains what happened** without making them feel like a failure.
- They like **simple, visually clean, mobile‑first** experiences with human language.

**What resonates**

- “No red ‘failure’ screens. No ‘you blew it again’ copy.”
- “Most days, your score will say: ‘You’re okay.’ When it drops, we’ll explain why in plain language.”
- “Looking at your Spain trip or a ‘treat yourself’ month shouldn’t feel like punishment. It’s just information.”
- “You don’t have to engage every day. myTruv is here when you’re ready to check in.”

**What to avoid**

- Guilt‑driven messaging (“fix your bad habits”, “stop wasting money”).
- Aggressive notifications.
- Daily gamified rings as the *main* mechanic (they can exist, but as gentle, optional celebration).

## Persona 3 — “Working Middle America”

**Snapshot**

- Age: 30–40  
- Income: $45–85k household  
- Status: Full‑time employee (maybe with a partner & kids)  
- Tech: Intermediate → comfortable with mainstream apps, not a power user  
- Devices: iOS or Android; often uses laptop/desktop at work  
- Tools today: bank app, a basic spreadsheet, maybe notes on phone

**Money situation**

- Life is full: work, commuting, family, errands.
- Knows they **should** pay more attention, but there’s limited bandwidth.
- Wants:
  - “Am I okay overall?”
  - “Are my balances trending up or down?”
  - “Can I afford this big thing without being stupid?”

**Primary pains**

- No time or desire to run a complex “money project”.
- Confused by multi‑tab budgeting apps.
- Feels mild, continuous background worry: “I think I’m fine, but I’m not sure.”

**Why one scroll works**

- They want an experience that matches how they use their phone:
  - 30 seconds in line,
  - quick check at lunch,
  - scroll once before bed.
- A simple mobile view with:
  - **Truv Score**,
  - current **balances & cushions**,
  - **2–3 short insights** in plain English  
  is exactly right.

**What resonates**

- “Check your money in the time it takes to scroll a single screen.”
- “Your score and trends are explained in plain English, not finance jargon.”
- “You don’t need to care about categories unless you want to.”
- “After work, you don’t have to become your own CFO — just check your score and move on.”

**What to avoid**

- Long setups, questionnaires, complex onboarding.
- Requiring them to religiously log in daily.
- Making them feel like they “must” understand advanced concepts to use the app.

## Persona 4 — “Self‑Employed with Chaotic Income”

**Snapshot**

- Age: 30–40  
- Income: 40–100k, but extremely lumpy  
- Status: Self‑employed / freelancer / contractor / small business  
- Tech: Advanced, heavy‑online, uses multiple tools  
- Devices: Mix of Android/iOS + laptop (often Windows)  
- Tools today: bank app, spreadsheets, invoicing + accounting tools, sometimes budgeting apps

**Money situation**

- Income is **lumpy and unpredictable**:
  - one strong month, one slow,
  - big invoices followed by dry spells.
- Has to juggle:
  - taxes,
  - irregular bills,
  - occasional big business expenses,
  - personal life on top.
- Traditional monthly budgets feel like a lie:
  - “Every month is different, so the budget is always wrong.”

**Primary pains**

- Constant low‑grade anxiety: “Will this month work out?”
- Doesn’t have a stable way to answer: “Can I safely take this month off / do this trip / invest in this equipment?”
- Daily or weekly rings would be **emotionally brutal**, because their numbers swing.

**Why long‑horizon, stable score is key**

- They need a **steady “system health” signal** over months:
  - “Is my overall system holding up?”
  - “Am I building cushion or burning it?”
- They want **event‑level stories**:
  - how a big invoice,
  - a tax payment,
  - an equipment purchase  
  change the picture.

**What resonates**

- “myTruv smooths your chaos into one wellbeing score and a few key trend lines.”
- “We show how your big swings (invoices, tax payments, trips) affect your long‑term picture — without panic.”
- “You don’t need a perfect monthly budget to see if you’re still on stable ground.”
- “We quietly build and track buffers for taxes, emergencies and slow months.”

**What to avoid**

- Messaging that assumes a neat monthly paycheck.
- “Just stick to your monthly budget.”
- Any implication that they’re failing because their cashflow is non‑standard.

## Anxiety‑Heavy “Some College” Pattern

> Not a full persona, but a critical emotional pattern that overlaps with several personas.

**Snapshot**

- Education: “Some college”  
- Feel_score: lowest group in the research  
- Status: mix of full‑time, part‑time, or unstable work  
- Tech: Mixed, but generally comfortable with mainstream apps

**Money situation**

- Feels like they “should already have it together” but don’t.
- Experiences money as:
  - chaos,
  - shame,
  - frequent small crises.
- Often avoids looking at accounts; terrified of what they might see.

**Primary pains**

- Deep sense of “I’m failing at adulting.”
- Educational content or “learn to budget” messaging feels like homework they’re already behind on.
- Hyper‑sensitive to any hint of blame.

**Why no‑hustle & shame‑free is essential**

- A daily fitness‑style tracker for money would **worsen** their self‑image.
- They need:
  - a **friendly, low‑pressure** check‑in,
  - “here’s where you actually are”,
  - and “it’s not the end of the world”.

**What resonates**

- “You were never really taught how to do money. That’s okay.”
- “Your score explains your situation — not your worth as a person.”
- “You don’t have to engage every day. We’ll be here whenever you’re ready for clarity.”
- “We can’t change rent or healthcare, but we can help you be less exposed to them.”

**What to avoid**

- Any copy that sounds like a scolding parent or teacher.
- Heavy financial jargon.
- Complex onboarding or “courses” as a requirement to get value.

## 1. Shared Traits Across Personas 🤝

Regardless of age / income, most people who will love myTruv:

- feel that money is **mentally heavy** (chaos, guilt, fatigue),
- have already tried **something**:
  - bank apps, spreadsheets, budgeting tools,
- don’t want another system they have to maintain,
- want to know:
  - “Am I okay?”
  - “What changed?”
  - “What’s one realistic thing I can do?”

Brand promise stays the same for everyone:

> **AI‑powered, no‑hustle, always‑worth‑opening money companion.**

Personas below change **which pain we press** and **which examples we use**, not the core identity.

## 2. Persona 1 — “Exhausted Power User”

### Snapshot

- Age: ~28–45  
- Income: mid to high  
- Status: full‑time or self‑employed  
- Tech: advanced, 6+ hours online/day  
- Tools today: bank apps, spreadsheets, maybe YNAB / Monarch / Copilot etc.

### Relationship with money

- Understands budgeting deeply: can build complex Excel and category rules.
- Has tried “doing everything right” multiple times.
- Still feels like money is **never quite under control**, especially with fluctuating months.
- Feels **tool fatigue** and low‑grade guilt when they stop maintaining systems.

### Main pains

- “I know what I should do, but I don’t have the energy to do it forever.”
- Every new app wants them to **do more work**.
- Feels like a part‑time CFO for their own life.

### What resonates

- “Not another dashboard. myTruv sits on top of the tools you already have.”
- “You don’t maintain myTruv — it maintains itself.”
- “One calm score, one scroll, and 1–3 moves that actually matter.”
- “We respect the work you’ve already done. We turn it into autopilot instead of asking for more.”

### What to avoid

- “Build your perfect budget.”
- “Track everything.”
- Any onboarding that feels like setting up another complex system.

## 3. Persona 2 — “Emotional iOS Spender”

### Snapshot

- Age: ~22–40  
- Income: varied (from students/early career to mid income)  
- Status: mostly full‑time, some side‑hustles  
- Tech: intermediate, iPhone‑centric, likes clean apps  
- Tools today: bank app, maybe one budgeting app, sometimes a simple sheet

### Relationship with money

- Spends more when stressed / sad / bored.
- Has waves of “treat yourself” months.
- Sometimes **avoids** opening banking apps for days/weeks.
- Feels **guilt and embarrassment** about money.

### Main pains

- Gamified apps (rings, streaks) quickly become:
  - “I failed again → I’ll stop opening it.”
- Red charts and “overspent” warnings hurt and trigger avoidance.
- Needs emotional **safety** more than data.

### What resonates

- “No red failure screens. No ‘you blew it again’ copy.”
- “Most days, your score will say: ‘You’re okay.’ When it drops, we explain why in plain language.”
- “Looking at your Vegas weekend, Cancun trip or a ‘treat yourself’ month shouldn’t feel like punishment. It’s just information.”
- “You don’t have to engage every day. myTruv is here when you’re ready to check in.”

### What to avoid

- “Fix your bad habits”, “stop wasting money”.
- Copy that sounds like a disappointed parent or teacher.
- Hard streak mechanics as the *main* motivator.

## 4. Persona 3 — “Working Middle America”

### Snapshot

- Age: ~30–50  
- Income: roughly middle‑income household  
- Status: full‑time, often with partner/kids  
- Tech: intermediate; uses common apps but not a “power user”  
- Tools today: bank app, basic spreadsheet, maybe notes

### Relationship with money

- Life is full: work, commute, kids, errands.
- Money is a **background worry**, not a hobby.
- Feels like “I think we’re fine, but I’m not 100% sure.”

### Main pains

- No energy for complex budgeting rituals.
- Multi‑tab finance apps feel too heavy.
- Wants a **quick check‑in**, not a weekend project.

### What resonates

- “Check your whole money picture in the time it takes to scroll one screen.”
- “Your score and trends are explained in plain English, not finance jargon.”
- “One score that says whether you’re okay. If something needs attention, we tell you where and why.”
- Examples around:
  - Disney trip,
  - new car payment,
  - rising groceries / daycare.

### What to avoid

- Long questionnaires and heavy onboarding flows.
- Requiring daily engagement.
- Making them feel “behind” because they don’t optimise everything.

## 5. Persona 4 — “Self‑Employed with Chaotic Income”

### Snapshot

- Age: ~25–50  
- Income: from modest to high, but **lumpy**  
- Status: self‑employed / contractors / freelancers / small business owners  
- Tech: advanced; heavy online; uses tools for work (invoicing, CRMs, etc.)  
- Tools today: bank apps, spreadsheets, invoicing/accounting software, sometimes budgeting apps

### Relationship with money

- Revenue is: big invoice → quiet month → another spike.
- Has to juggle:
  - taxes,
  - irregular bills,
  - personal + business mixed together.
- Monthly budgets feel like lies.

### Main pains

- Constant underlying anxiety: “Can I afford a slow month? A trip? A new laptop?”
- Doesn’t have a stable way to answer: “Am I actually progressing or just surviving?”
- Daily or weekly gamification is emotionally brutal: numbers swing a lot.

### What resonates

- “myTruv smooths your chaos into one wellbeing score and a few trend lines.”
- “You see if your system is holding up over months, not just days.”
- “We show exactly how big events (invoices, tax payments, trips) affected your runway.”
- “We help you build and track buffers for taxes, emergencies and slow periods.”

### What to avoid

- Messaging that assumes a neat monthly salary.
- “Just stick to your monthly budget.”
- Anything that suggests they’re failing because their income is irregular.

## 6. Persona 5 — “Anxiety‑Heavy ‘Some College’ Pattern”

_Not a full demographic persona, but a critical emotional pattern that overlaps multiple groups._

### Snapshot

- Education: “Some college”, stopped before degree  
- Status: mixed (full‑time, part‑time, unstable work)  
- Tech: mixed, but comfortable with mainstream apps  
- Emotion: feel they “should already have it together”, but don’t.

### Relationship with money

- Money = **shame + chaos**.
- Often avoids checking balances.
- Feels like everyone else is secretly ahead.

### Main pains

- Financial education feels like **homework they’re already behind on**.
- Hyper‑sensitive to blame; very quick to internalise:
  - “I’m just bad with money.”
- Traditional budgeting content is intimidating.

### What resonates

- “You were never really taught how to do this. That’s okay.”
- “Your score describes your situation, not your worth.”
- “You don’t have to open the app every day. When you do, you’ll get clarity, not a lecture.”
- Emphasis on:
  - validation,
  - small safe steps,
  - ‘system’ language instead of ‘you’re failing’ language.

### What to avoid

- Any tone that could be read as “you should know this by now”.
- Heavy jargon and complex flows.
- Demanding long‑term commitment up front.

## 7. Using Personas in Practice

When you work on a feature, page or campaign:

1. **Pick one primary persona**  
   - “Who are we mainly helping here?”

2. **Choose their key pain**  
   - Exhausted Power User → tool fatigue & complexity.  
   - Emotional iOS Spender → shame & avoidance.  
   - Self‑Employed → chaos & unpredictability.  
   - etc.

3. **Frame the outcome in their language**  
   - Use examples they recognise (Vegas weekend, Disney trip, car repair, medical bill, side‑hustle month).

4. **Keep the global promise constant**  
   - AI‑powered, no‑hustle, shame‑free, always worth opening.

If something works only for one persona but feels off‑brand for others, it probably shouldn’t be in the core product.
